Welcome to Orca
===============

A bot framework that is easy to reason about, easy to debug, and easy to use.

**Features:**

- Easy to use for the end users

  - We use multi-threading and synchronous IO to support concurrency so you only need to focus on the logic.
  - We carefully craft the library to use computing resources efficiently so performance should never be an issue.
- Easy to reason about the code

  - We use the most native data structures, the simplest algorithms, and intuitive interfaces.
- Easy to debug (networking and logic) errors

  - Extensive assertion and logging facilities.
